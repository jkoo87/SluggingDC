Because of some of the changes there are a few names to describe this location (Bob's, Springfield Plaza, Long John Silvers, Chi Chi's).  All names are actually the same slug line. There are two slug lines that operate out of the commuter lot. Line #1: L’Enfant Plaza and 14th street. Line #2: 18th Street locations (sometimes called Memorial Bridge).",
